# 1 In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both? In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?
# print ("Hello World"
# A. SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
# 2. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks,
# or both?
# print ('hello)
# A. SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
# 3. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?
# A. print(2+-2) = 0 ,  print(2++2) = 4
# 4. In math notation, leading zeros are ok, as in 09. What happens if you try this in Python? What about 011?
# A. print(09) = SyntaxError: leading zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted; use an 0o prefix for octal integers
# A. print (011) = SyntaxError: leading zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted; use an 0o prefix for octal integers
# 5. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?
# A. print (22 22) = What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?
# 6. How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?
# A. minutes = 60 , print(((minutes*42)+42)) = 2562 Seconds
# 7. How many miles are there in 10 kilometers? Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile.
# A. miles = (1*1.61) ,print(miles*10) = 16.1 km
# 8. If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average speed in miles per hour?
# miles = (10/1.61)
# print (miles)  6.211180124223602
# print ((((60*42)+42)/miles),"seconds") 412.482 seconds
# print ((60/miles),"Miles Per hour") 9.660000000000002 Miles Per hour
